# 🗨️ Prompts

[**This document**](https://github.com/timothyfraser/aisystemshackathon/blob/main/docs/prompts.md) will be updated at the start of the Hackathon event to contain 3 short prompts. Teams will be asked to pick 1 prompt and design an AI-powered tool around it. Please check back at kickoff for details!

### 💡 The Challenge

Over 24 hours, your team will build and deploy a new **AI-powered system** in response to one of three prompts.

- 3 prompts released at kickoff — each tied to a stakeholder need that you will address
- Incorporate **generative AI** (e.g., OpenAI or Ollama Cloud) into your solution
- Build something functional and **demo-ready** (REST API, Dashboard, or other deployable app)
- Meet a specific stakeholder need in response to your chosen prompt

In this Hackathon, you will build a tool that uses AI to solve a real-world problem.

### ⚙️ Requirements

1. 🚀 **Possible Outputs**: A publicly available, deployable tool, such as:
   - A REST API (e.g., built with Plumber in R or FastAPI/Flask in Python)
   - A Dashboard (e.g., Shiny app in R or Streamlit/Dash in Python)
   - Another deployable app (e.g., deployed to Posit Connect)
2. 🤖 **Generative AI**: Your tool must incorporate queries to a generative AI model (OpenAI or Ollama Cloud, or similar).
3. 📈 **2–3 test datasets** that demonstrate the tool’s effectiveness. These can be synthetic but should represent real-world data your tool would use.
4. 📑 **A codebook and README** for your datasets and tool — what each file and variable means, and how to run the tool.

### 🗨️ Example Prompt

Prompts will be released at the start of the Hackathon on this page. Example style (solution-neutral; many different tools could address it):

> Design a system that helps a stakeholder monitor a key metric and get AI-generated summaries or recommendations. Provide synthetic data and a working demo (e.g., API or dashboard).

### 💡 Prompts

Please pick **1** of the following prompts below and create an AI-powered tool to address the problem. **Prompts will be released at kickoff on this page.**

*You do not need prior domain expertise. Use what you know and what you can find quickly to build a sensible, useful tool.*

When building your tool, refer to the [**🔢 Evaluation Criteria**](https://github.com/timothyfraser/aisystemshackathon/blob/main/docs/criteria.md) and 📚 [**Resources for Building Your Tool**](https://github.com/timothyfraser/aisystemshackathon/blob/main/docs/resources.md).

#### Prompt 1: [Domain TBD at kickoff]

*Content to be added at kickoff.*

#### Prompt 2: [Domain TBD at kickoff]

*Content to be added at kickoff.*

#### Prompt 3: [Domain TBD at kickoff]

*Content to be added at kickoff.*

### 💬 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

- **I signed up for one topic in the signup survey. Can I pick a different topic?** Yes.
- **How long do I have to pick a topic?** Pick your topic within the first 15–30 minutes of the Hackathon and then stick to it so you have maximum build time.
- **Where do I find tutorials?** 📚 [Resources for Building Your Tool](https://github.com/timothyfraser/aisystemshackathon/blob/main/docs/resources.md)

### 🔧 Example Techniques

- Querying generative AI (OpenAI API, Ollama Cloud)
- Prompt engineering for summaries, recommendations, or classifications
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Function calling / tool use with LLMs
- Building and calling REST APIs
- Storing and querying data (e.g., Supabase/PostgreSQL)
- Deploying apps (e.g., Posit Connect)
- Using Cursor IDE for AI-assisted coding

### 👍 Advice

- This project is short-term. Define a narrow scope so you can finish on time.
- A small product that works is better than a large one that doesn’t.
- Delegate: use your team — different people can own data, API, AI, and deployment.
- Use the optional trainings early (Query AI, Supabase, API, Cursor, Posit Connect) to unblock yourself.
