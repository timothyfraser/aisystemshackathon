## About Mentors

In this event, SYSEN MEng / MS students (and SYSEN 5381 / 5460 participants) work in teams for 24 hours to build **AI-powered systems** in Python or R. Students pick one of three prompts and build a deployable tool that incorporates generative AI and meets a stakeholder need.

**As a mentor, you are asked to attend just 1–2 hours of the event — Mentor Hours — where you go around and meet with a few teams and offer encouragement and feedback.**

- ⏰ **When are Mentor Hours?** Friday 3/6 at 7:00 PM and Saturday 3/7 at 10:00 AM.
- You can attend Friday OR Saturday OR both, based on your availability.
- Thank you for sharing your time on the weekend!
